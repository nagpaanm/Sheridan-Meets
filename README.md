# Sheridan-Meets
Sheridan-Meets is an online 'networking' web-application that I created using Java (Springboot) and mySQL. It is targeted primarily toward Sheridan College students. The application can be found at this location: https://sheridan-meets.herokuapp.com/

This application allows users to upload pictures, select their respective interests and hobbies, and ultimately match with other users of their choice by swipping through a queue-like data structure. Upon matching, users are able to chat with one another via. a chatbox.
